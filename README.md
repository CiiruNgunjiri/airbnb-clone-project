# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project focuses on backend development, database design, API creation, and application security, providing a comprehensive learning experience in building scalable and secure web applications.

## Project Goals
- Implement secure user management including registration and authentication.
- Develop property listing features with CRUD operations.
- Create a booking system to manage reservations.
- Integrate payment processing for handling transactions.
- Enable users to post reviews and ratings.
- Optimize database performance with indexing and caching.
- Document APIs using OpenAPI and support flexible querying with GraphQL.
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Query Language:** GraphQL
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery
- **Caching & Session Management:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or similar platforms

## Technology Stack Description

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend RESTful APIs, handling business logic, and managing server-side operations.

- **Django REST Framework:** An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, providing tools for serialization, authentication, and viewsets.

- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage the application's data securely and efficiently.

- **GraphQL:** A flexible query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency over traditional REST endpoints.

- **Celery:** An asynchronous task queue used to handle background tasks such as sending notifications and processing payments without blocking the main application flow.

- **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing user sessions to improve application performance.

- **Docker:** A containerization platform that ensures consistent development and deployment environments across different machines.

- **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions):** Automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes, enhancing development efficiency and reducing errors.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes creating API endpoints, managing business logic, and ensuring secure and efficient data processing.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the design, implementation, and maintenance of the database systems. Responsibilities include optimizing queries, indexing, ensuring data integrity, backup, and recovery.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services. Implements CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization (e.g., Docker), and ensures the infrastructure is reliable and secure.

### QA Engineer
Ensures the backend functionalities meet quality standards through rigorous testing. Designs test cases, performs automated and manual testing, and verifies bug fixes and feature implementations.
